          Central repository for rules

    longDescription: >
          A number of governments are working to publish the rules they now use internally to develop
          and manage systems. Several municipalities are already publishing their rules or are planning to do so.

          It is useful if government authorities not only publish their rules themselves, but also make them centrally
          findable and coordinate which concepts and structures are used in the rules. Ideally, there will
          be a central repository where these rules can be searched. A location comparable to wetten.overheid.nl
          for legislation or data.overheid.nl for data sources of the government.
