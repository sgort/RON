# Data Standard Personal Finance (GPF)

A major challenge in retrieving and sharing personal data is standardization. Because citizens operate in multiple domains, such as central and local governments, banks, insurance, web-based retail, etc., they have to deal with multiple standards.

In order to set up the GPF, we took the data request as our starting point. The data question is often a form (paper or web-based) with multiple questions. These questions can be answered by using data from multiple sources, which are accessible according to different standards.

Within the GPF, the data requester defines for each question which data from which source is expected as an answer. Because the data requester is obliged to indicate where the answer should come from, there is no ambiguity about what is expected. This allows tools such as the FP app to unambiguously search for the answer from the relevant source. This prevents confusion and incorrectly completed forms with all its consequences.

In addition to describing the standard of how to document data queries, the GPF also describes subsets of data. These subsets are predefined, agreed between the parties and contain only the data that is necessary for a defined data request and no more.

This definition provides citizens with some assurance that a reasonable and appropriate amount of personal data will be transferred in the sharing. This definition of subsets also provides the data requester with some assurance that the data received fits within the processing agreement of the recipient and that the receipt is GDPR-proof.
